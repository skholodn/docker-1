# docker-1
first DevOps experience in Docker

***The first project on the Docker ecosystem. It helps to learn about containers, their installation and configuration using the docker binary. I also created my first containers with Dockerfiles.***

### This project is made from small task, which are solved with the help of Docker. Task can be found in ```project_task.pdf``` and its solution you can find in ```project_dir```.
